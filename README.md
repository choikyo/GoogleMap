# Project: Travelers To-do List
This project is a single page web application that shows a selected list of beatiful national parks and forests in United States

## Installation
Go to any folder on your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/choikyo/GoogleMap.git
```
The above command downloads the project into GoogleMap folder

# Run
Open the file "Traveler_To-do_List.html" in a web browser

# Features!
- This project is powered by Google Map Api, Google Geographic Api, Google Streetview Api, and 3rd party OpenWeather Api
- This sample project takes a JSON data set within the javascript, which is hard-coded. 
- Button to show all parks, and button to hide parks
- Once state dropdown menu is selected, map should zoom into state level,  and "Choose a park" dropdown list should only show the filtered results
- Click a marker to see stree view
- Click a marker to see current weather and temperature 
- Responsive Design

# Things to improve
- Location data (JSON) can be loaded from either a DB, or an external JSON file
- Some beautifying work needs to be done to UI (using Boostrap). I have removed the original Boostrap design due to how ugly I made the color NOT matching the map
- The responsive design is too simple. Ideally, I would like this to have a well behaved hamburger button.
